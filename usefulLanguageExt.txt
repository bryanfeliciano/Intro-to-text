ViewPatterns—Allows for more-sophisticated pattern matching.

TemplateHaskell—Provides tools for Haskell metaprogramming.

DuplicateRecordFields—Solves the annoying problem from lesson 16, where using
the same field name for different types using record syntax causes a conflict.

NoImplicitPrelude—As mentioned, some Haskell programmers prefer to use a
custom Prelude. This language extension allows you to not use the default Prelude.
